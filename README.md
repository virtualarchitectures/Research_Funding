# Research Funding
A list of research funding institutions for research conducted in the UK

- [UK Research and Innovation (UKRI)](https://www.ukri.org/) - UK Research and Innovation works in partnership with universities, research organisations, businesses, charities, and government to create the best possible environment for research and innovation to flourish. We aim to maximise the contribution of each of our component parts, working individually and collectively. We work with our many partners to benefit everyone through knowledge, talent and ideas. Operating across the whole of the UK with a combined budget of more than £8 billion, UK Research and Innovation brings together the seven research councils, Innovate UK and Research England.
  - [Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC)](https://ahrc.ukri.org/) - At the Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC) we fund world-class, independent researchers in a wide range of subjects from history and archaeology to philosophy and languages. We also fund more contemporary research including the design and effectiveness of digital content and the impact of artificial intelligence. We fund a range of research and post-graduate calls.
  - [Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)](https://epsrc.ukri.org/) - The Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) is the main funding body for engineering and physical sciences research in the UK. By investing in research and postgraduate training, we are building the knowledge and skills base needed to address the scientific and technological challenges facing the nation. 
  - [Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC)](https://esrc.ukri.org/) - We are the UK's largest organisation for funding research on economic and social issues. We support independent, high quality research which has an impact on business, the public sector and civil society. ESRC's total budget for 2017-18 was around £202 million. At any one time ESRC supports over 4,000 researchers and postgraduate students in academic institutions and independent research institutes.
  - [Innovate UK](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/innovate-uk) - Innovate UK is part of UK Research and Innovation, a non-departmental public body funded by a grant-in-aid from the UK government. Since 2007, we have invested around £2.5 billion to help businesses across the country to innovate, with match funding from industry taking the total value of projects above £4.3 billion. We fund business and research collaborations to accelerate innovation and drive business investment into research and development.
- [The British Academy](https://www.thebritishacademy.ac.uk/) - The British Academy is the UK’s leader for the humanities and social sciences. Our purpose is to deepen understanding of people, societies and cultures, enabling everyone to learn, progress and prosper. The British Academy provides a variety of grants and fellowships to support academic research, career development and wider engagement across the full range of the humanities and social sciences. Funding opportunities cover UK and international research from the postdoctoral level upwards, supporting the best ideas, individuals and intellectual resources.
- [The Royal Society](https://royalsociety.org/) - The Society’s fundamental purpose, reflected in its founding Charters of the 1660s, is to recognise, promote, and support excellence in science and to encourage the development and use of science for the benefit of humanity. The Royal Society funds researchers at the postdoctoral level and above in the UK and overseas. Undergraduate, Masters and PhD students cannot apply for Royal Society funding.
Research must be within the Society’s remit of natural sciences, which includes but is not limited to biological research, chemistry, engineering, mathematics and physics
- [Royal Academy of Engineering(RAEng)](https://www.raeng.org.uk/) - The Royal Academy of Engineering is a charity that harnesses the power of engineering to build a sustainable society and an inclusive economy that works for everyone. The Academy runs a programme of grants and prizes to support and celebrate the pursuit of engineering activities and to enable closer contact between academia and industry. These schemes support engineering professionals, academics and students in numerous ways including study bursaries, business start-up funding, research projects, knowledge transfer partnerships, public engagement and prizes recognising significant feats of engineering.
- [Wellcome Trust](https://wellcome.org/) - Wellcome exists to improve health by helping great ideas to thrive. We support researchers, we take on big health challenges, we campaign for better science, and we help everyone get involved with science and health research. Today, we have a £26.8 billion investment portfolio which funds all the work we do. In the next five years, we plan to spend around £5 billion helping people across the world explore great ideas.
